"""
Catanatron's moves, results, legal moves and states in the Open Seat Protocol (see ../PROTOCOL.md), and back.

Seats are the players' indices in Catanatron's turn order (state.colors). Catanatron discards one card per decision; the
protocol discards the whole set at once, so a discard is enumerated as every set of the right size the hand can pay
(discard_options) and played card by card (discard_actions). The state is the full one (every hand), as a referee or an
open-hand agent sees it.
