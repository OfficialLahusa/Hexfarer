/**
 * Every move of a JSettlers game on this process's server as Open Seat Protocol steps (see ../../PROTOCOL.md), with its
 * result as the referee knows it and the true state before it. JSettlers' server hands each player's request to its
 * message handler on one thread; OSPServer's handler passes it through dispatch here, which reads the game before and
 * after JSettlers handles it and turns the change into a step: one protocol move where JSettlers takes two requests (a
 * bought piece and its place, a card and its resources, a robber move and its victim), and the discards after a 7, which
 * JSettlers' players make at the same time, one after another from the lowest seat, each with the state the protocol's
 * order gives it. A change no request made (the server ending a slow player's turn, say) counts as a gap: the next step
 * then starts from another state than the last one ended in.
 *
 * The log's monitor is the lock for reading the game: a robot's brain that reads under it (OSPServer.read) sees no move
 * half handled. With the system property osp.record set, each game is also written there as a referee log while it
 * runs (GAME.jsonl, or GAME-2.jsonl and so on if an earlier server run wrote that game's name: before, a decide and a step
 * per move, after with the result record), the input of Hexfarer's replay harness and relay. At its end each game writes
 * its result record (see PROTOCOL.md) as one osp-result line to standard error: the players by seat, the winner, and per
 * seat the agent and its decisions, their time, resyncs, fallbacks and failures (filled in by the seat's brain), its
 * moves, those with a choice (only for a recorded game: the legal moves are listed only for its decide lines, to spare
 * the server's message thread) and the CPU time of its robot's brain thread in this game.
