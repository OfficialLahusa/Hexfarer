 * state as the referee or a seat sees it, the legal moves of the seat that acts, and playing a move with its result.
 * The legal moves are the protocol's moves JSettlers' own checks allow (SOCGame's and SOCPlayer's can... methods), one
 * protocol move where JSettlers takes two steps: a robber move with its victim, a Year of Plenty or Monopoly card with its
 * resources, a bought road, settlement or city with its place. JSettlers' players discard at the same time after a 7;
 * the protocol asks them one after another, from the lowest seat. JSettlers keeps no resource bank: the bank is what the
 * hands leave of 19 cards a resource. JSettlers draws who starts; the protocol's seats are the turn order from the first
 * player (seat 0 starts), so a JSettlers player number becomes seatOf it.
